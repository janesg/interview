Issues:

- Struggled to convert a basic IntelliJ project into a Maven project. In the end I created a new Maven project from scratch, copied over the contents from previous project and made some config file edits.
- Installed latest JDK 9 and switched project language level to Java 9. Hoping to use Nashorn support for ES6 but by default it only supports 5.1 and there's no way I've found of passing the necessary command line argument (--language=es6) to JUnit tests in Intellij.
